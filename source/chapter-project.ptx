  <title>Managing a <prefigure/> project</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Up to this point, we have focused on creating individual
    diagrams.  Most likely, however, authors will want to create a
    collection of diagrams for a document, such as a book or article,
    and will want to maintain some consistency across diagrams.  This
    chapter describes how a publication file can be used for this
    purpose.  In addition, we will describe how to author <prefigure/>
    diagrams within a <pretext/> document.
