  <title>Loading external images</title>

  <p>Some diagrams may need to import an external image and then add
  some features.  For instance, one may want to load a topographical
  map and add a vector indicating the gradient of the elevation
  function.  <prefigure/> supports importing PNG, JPEG, GIF, and SVG
  images with the <tag>image</tag> element.  <xref
  ref="diagram-wasatch"/> and the accompanying source <xref
  ref="listing-wasatch"/> demonstrate.</p>

    ref="diagram-wasatch"/>.</caption> 
  </listing>

  <p>The <attr>source</attr> attribute is the name of the file that
  contains the image.  Finding this image file in the local file
  system is handled in the same way that external data files are
  found, as described in <xref ref="subsec-reading-file"/>.  That is
  to say, if there is a <prefigure/> publication file, then the value
  of the 
  attribute <attr>directories/data</attr> is prepended to the value of
  the <attr>image/source</attr> attribute.  For instance, if
  <attr>source="images/my_image.jpg"</attr> and
  <attr>directories/data="/home/user/projects/"</attr>, then
  <prefigure/> will expect the image file to be in
  <c>/home/user/projects/images/my_image.jpg"</c>.</p>

  <p>If <attr>directories/data</attr> is not given in a <prefigure/>
  publication file, then the value of <attr>source</attr> is
  interpreted relative to the <prefigure/> source file.</p>

  <p>Within a <pretext/> project, the value of
  <attr>docinfo/data</attr> should be a directory that contains the
  image file, possibly in a sub-directory as indicated by the value of
  <attr>image/source</attr>.  For example, if
  <attr>source="images/my_image.jpg"</attr> and
  <attr>docinfo/data="/home/book/source/data"</attr>, then the file should
  live at <c>/home/book/source/data/images/my_image.jpg</c>.  (Of
  course, one would not 
  likely give an absolute path in <attr>docinfo/data</attr>.)</p>

  <p><prefigure/> attempts to identify the image format from the file
  name's suffix.  For instance, <c>image.gif</c> is assumed to be a
  GIF.  If the file name suffix does not properly denote the image
  type, include the attribute <attr>filetype</attr>, whose value can
  be <c>"svg"</c>, <c>"png"</c>, <c>"gif"</c>, <c>"jpg"</c>, or
  <c>"jpeg"</c>.</p>

  <p>The location and sizing of the image is determined by a rectangle
  defined through the attributes <attr>center</attr>,
  <attr>lower-left</attr>, and <attr>dimensions</attr>.  Only one of
  <attr>center</attr> and <attr>lower-left</attr> needs to be given.
  The image will be scaled in such a way so as to preserve its aspect
  ratio and to fit inside the rectangle.</p>

  <p>Additional attributes include <attr>rotate</attr>, which defines
  an angle, epxressed in degrees, by which the image is to be rotated
  about its center.  The attribute <attr>scale</attr> can be either a
  single number or an ordered pair to scale by different amounts
  horizontally and vertically.  Scaling is not strictly enforced,
  however, since the image is already scaled to fit inside the
  prescribed rectangle.  What may be most useful is
  <attr>scale="(-1,1)"</attr> to flip the image.  Finally,
  <attr>opacity</attr> gives a value for the opacity to use when
  including the image, as demonstrated in <xref
  ref="listing-wasatch"/>.</p>

    <title>Caution</title>

    <p>Because <prefigure/> prioritizes accessible diagrams and
    imported images will likely not render well in an embossed tactile
    format, an <tag>image</tag> element must include elements intended
    to replace the image in a tactile diagram.  Notice that the
    <tag>image</tag> in <xref ref="listing-wasatch"/> contains a label
    with a brief description.
    </p>
  </assemblage>

  <p><xref ref="diagram-attack"/> illustrates a <prefigure/> version
  of a diagram from the
  <url
      href="https://pretextbook.org/examples/sample-article/html/section-graphics.html#figure-shark-attack"
      text="custom">
    <pretext/> sample article.
  </url>  Notice how the image of the shark is scaled to flip it
  horizontally.  A rectangle is also drawn around the swimmer to
  illustrate how the image is scaled to fit inside its rectangle (and
  to protect the swimmer from the shark).
  Finally, note that the tactile replacements for these images each
  consist of a labeled point showing the location of the shark and the
  swimmer.  Thanks to Stephen Brown for permission to reproduce this
  image.</p>
