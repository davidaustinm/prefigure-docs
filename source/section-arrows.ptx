  <title>Arrows</title>

  <p>Arrows can appear in many different contexts within a PreFigure
  diagram.  For instance, a <tag>vector</tag> will be drawn with an
  arrowhead, usually at its tip, as seen in <xref
  ref="diagram-arrows-vector"/>.  Most graphical components that
  define a path, such as a <tag>polygon</tag> and
  <tag>parametric-curve</tag>, can be decorated with arrows.
  </p>

  <p>In constrast, a <tag>slope-field</tag> may have
  many arrows, one on the end of each line segment, as shown in <xref
  ref="diagram-arrows-slope"/> .

  <p> As a result, it is possible to adjust the relative size and
  shape of arrowheads.  Before describing the possibilities, however,
  it is important to recognize that the size of arrowheads is scaled
  by the <attr>thickness</attr> attribute so, for instance, the
  arrowhead on a line whose <attr>thickness=3</attr> will be three
  times the size as one on a line whose <attr>thickness=1</attr>.
  </p>

  <p>
  <xref ref="diagram-arrow-properties"/> shows a variety of choices
  for defining the appearance of arrowheads.  Notice that there are
  two attributes, <attr>arrow-width</attr> and
  <attr>arrow-angles</attr>, that can be specified and that are
  described more fully below.
  </p>

    ref="diagram-arrow-properties"/>. </caption>
  </listing>

  <p> Notice that a <tag>line</tag> has an
  <attr>additional-arrows</attr> attribute that allows one to include
  arrowheads at various locations along the line.  The locations are
  given as a number between 0 and 1 specifying the relative distance
  along the line segment.
  </p>

  <p>The shape of an arrowhead and how it is attached to the end of a
  path is shown in <xref 
  ref="diagram-arrow-defs"/>.  Once again, the size of the arrowhead
  is scaled by the <attr>thickness</attr> of the path.  
  (This style of arrowhead is adapted
  from Bill Casselman's <url
  ref="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cass/piscript/" target="_blank">
  PiScript</url> package.)

  <p><xref ref="diagram-arrow-angle-def"/> shows the meaning of the
  <attr>angle-width</attr> and <attr>angle-angles</attr> attributes.
  The <attr>angle-width</attr>, whose value is in SVG coordinates and
  whose default is 4, controls how far from the path the arrowhead
  extends.  The <attr>angle-angles</attr> attribute is a pair of
  angles <m>(A,B)</m>, given in degrees.  The default values are
  <m>(24,60)</m>.

    <caption>The definitions of <attr>arrow-width=w</attr> and
    <attr>arrow-angles=(A,B)</attr>.
    </caption>
  </figure>

  <p>Defining these attributes in a publication file allows them to be
  applied to all the diagrams in a project.
  </p>

  <p> As we will see later, these attributes are ignored when placing
  arrowheads in a tactile diagram since the shape of the arrowheads is
  a convention within the braille community.
