  <title>Tactile diagrams</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>The original motivation for PreFigure arose from the
    difficulties in creating tactile diagrams from other
    source, such as TikZ.
    </p>

    <p>Tactile diagrams, at least the kind that <pretext/> and
    PreFigure authors will want to create, are a <url
    href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/15/1074036/ending-image-poverty/">
    relatively new medium,</url> and, as such, there are still some
    conventions that are not yet firmly established.  Ongoing research
    with blind and low-vision readers is determining best practices for
    the creation of tactile diagrams, and PreFigure will always
    implement these practices without demand on an author's attention.
    </p>

    <p>It cannot be stated strongly enough that attention to tactile
    diagrams will lead to the design of better diagrams for sighted
    readers.  Authors are strongly encouraged to create and explore
    tactile versions of their PreFigure diagrams and strive for a
    clean design.  There really is no excuse not to:  it's as easy as
    adding <c>-f tactile</c> to the PreFigure bulid command.

    <title>Anatomy of a tactile diagram</title>

    <p>Before we examine a tactile diagram, we should first consider the
    medium used to produce them.
    <ul>
      <li><p>While tactile diagrams may be rendered in a variety of
      ways, PreFigure diagrams will be produced by an embosser on
      11"<m>\times</m>11.5" paper.  More specifically, the tactile
      diagrams created by PreFigure are optimized to be embossed on a
      <url href="https://viewplus.com/">ViewPlus
      embosser.</url></p>

      <p>A tactile diagram produced by PreFigure is meant to use as
      much of the page as possible.  In particular, the diagram will
      most likely be scaled from the <attr>dimensions</attr> provided
      in the <tag>diagram</tag> element in such a way as to preserve
      the aspect ratio of the <attr>dimensions</attr>.
      </p>
      </li>

      <li><p>You may think of an embosser as a very low-resolution
      printer, 20 dots per inch to be precise (compared to 300 dpi for
      a standard printer).  An embossers works by raising the paper at
      a collection of these dots, each of which has a diameter of
      0.057 inches.  Dots can, however, be raised to a small number of
      different heights to simulate shading from white to gray to
      black.</p></li>

      <li><p>Text in a tactile diagram will be rendered in braille.
      Each braille cell is a 3<m>\times</m>2 array of dots, and the
      interline spacing between braille cells is 0.4 inches. This
      means that a typical page has about 25<m>\times</m>40 cells or
      roughly 1000 cells.  While a cell does not exactly correspond to
      a character of written text (some common words have braille
      contractions and some cells contain formatting information, such
      as a transition to italics), this figure speaks to the
      limitations of what can be conveyed in a tactile format.  While
      authors may initially view this as a restriction, experienced
      authors will see this as a feature that encourages good
      design.</p></li>

      <li><p>Mathematics is rendered in Nemeth braille by MathJax
      while regular text is converted by <c>liblouis</c> into UEB.  It
      is essential that <c>liblouis</c> be installed if you wish to
      build tactile diagrams on your local PreFigure installation. A
      PreFigure codespace takes care of this automatically.</p></li>

      <li><p>Labels are embedded with the Braille29 font, which is
      included with PreFigure.  Issuing the <c>prefig init</c> command
      will install this font on Linux or Mac-OS, and this happens
      automatically when a codespace is created.</p></li>

      <li><p>The command <c>prefig pdf foo</c> will create a PDF that
      embosses well on a ViewPlus embosser provided that 
      <c>rsvg-convert</c> is available.  Again, this is provided in a
      codespace.  The resolution given to <c>rsvg-convert</c> should
      always be 72, which is the PreFigure default.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>With that said, let's explore a tactile version of the ubiquitous
    tangent line figure, shown in <xref
    ref="diagram-tangent-3-tactile"/>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="diagram-tangent-3-tactile">
      <sidebyside width="90%">
	<image source="images/tangent-3-tactile"/>
      </sidebyside>
      <caption>A calculus diagram</caption>
    </figure>

    <p>There is no need to show the PreFigure source for this diagram
    since it is the same that we saw earlier in <xref
    ref="listing-tangent-3"/>.  Again, PreFigure adopts the <pretext/>
    motto:  <em>write once, read anywhere.</em>  Here are some things
    you may notice, however.

    <ul>
      <li><p> Foreground elements, such as the graph, tangent, and
      point, have a clear, white outline of 1/8".  This is based on
      the experience of blind readers' experience with PreFigure
      diagrams. </p></li>

      <li><p> Labels sit on top of a clear, white rectangle so that
      they stand out from other elements.  In fact, all labels are
      drawn last so that they sit on top of everything else.</p></li>

      <li><p>Labels on axes are aligned with tick marks according to
      guidelines published by <url
      ref="https://www.brailleauthority.org/tg/"> The Braille
      Authority of North America.</url></p></li>

      <li><p>Colors are not informative in a tactile diagram so
      defaults are chosen to render well on an embosser.  Filled
      regions will be rendered as lightgray and the stroke on, say,
      graphs will be changed to black.</p></li>

      <li><p>The point is rendered with a radius of 9 SVG units, which
      translates into 1/8" when embossed.  As with the white outline
      described above,
      authors should think of this distance as a good rule of thumb.
      </p></li>

      <li><p>While this may not be apparent in this figure, labels are
      carefully positioned so that the braille cells in the resulting
      PDF will lie on top of the 20 dpi embossing grid.  As a result,
      authors may
      sometimes notice that labels are not exactly where they expect
      since they will internally snap onto this grid.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Finally, notice the amount of space taken up by the braille
    label on the point, which translates into <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
    It is not uncommon for the labels you produce to be surprisingly
    long when rendered in braille.  This should lead authors to aspire
    to brevity in their use of labels, which is a design principle for
    better sighted diagrams as well.  Reading text and processing
    graphical information are different cognitive tasks so be
    economical when using text in your diagrams.  Instead, use a
    diagram's caption and surrounding text to provide additional
    context. </p>

    <title>PreFigure considerations for tactile diagrams</title>

    <p>With all of that said, attaining the goal of <q>write once, read
    anywhere</q> is aspirational, and authors will likely find that
    producing good tactile diagrams requires a bit of tweaking.
    </p>

    <p>First off, any attribute in a PreFigure element can be overridden
    in tactile form by prepending <c>tactile-</c> before it.  While this
    applies to any attribute, there are likely two attributes
    where this is most important.
    </p>

    <p>Since color cannot be used to disambiguate elements from one
    another, authors should consider stroking some features will a
    dashed line in a tactile diagram.  To do so, set
    <attr>tactile-dash="9 9"</attr> in a component to be stroked with
    a dash in a tactile diagram
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="diagram-judson-system">
      <sbsgroup>
	<sidebyside width="60%">
	  <image source="images/judson-system"/>
	</sidebyside>
	<sidebyside width="80%">
	  <image source="images/judson-system-tactile"/>
	</sidebyside>
      </sbsgroup>
      <caption>An ordinary and tactile diagram from the same PreFigure
      source.  Adapted from
      Tom Judson's

           target="_blank"> Ordinary Differential Equations
      Project</url>.      
      </caption>
    </figure>

    <p>In the source given below, notice how one of the solution
    curves has both attributes <attr>stroke="red"</attr> and
    <attr>tactile-dash="9 9"</attr>.  The stroke attribute will 
    be automaticaly overridden to <c>"black"</c> in a tactile diagram.
    Setting the 
    dash to <c>"9 9"</c> produces dashes that alternate 1/8" of stroke
    and 1/8" empty.</p>

    <listing xml:id="listing-judson-system">
      <program line-numbers="no">
	<code><xi:include href="code/judson-system.xml" parse="text"/></code>
      </program>
      <caption>The PreFigure source for <xref
      ref="diagram-judson-system"/>.</caption>
    </listing>

    <p>The other attribute you may wish to override in tactile form
    is the <attr>offset</attr> attribute of labels.  PreFigure tries
    to place labels appropriately so that they don't overlap with
    other elements, but an author will sometimes need to push a label
    a bit away from its default location.  Setting
    <c>tactile-offset="(4,4)"</c> will push the label an additional four
    units horiztonally and vertically before snapping onto the 20 dpi
    embossing grid.
    </p>

    <p>Finally, as discussed in <xref ref="sec-outlining"/>, since
    every foreground component in a tactile diagram 
    is outlined, you may need to put components in a <tag>group</tag>
    and the attribute <attr>outline="tactile"</attr>, which will first
    paint all the outlines in the group before painting the components
    themselves. </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-tactile-captions">
    <title>Captions in tactile diagrams</title>

    <p><prefigure/> tactile diagrams can, of course, be included in a
    <pretext/> document.  When a braille version of the document is
    created, the diagrams will be distributed as a set of PDFs
    separate from the rest of the document.  To help locate a given
    diagram within the document, <pretext/> adds a caption along the
    top of the diagram, which says something like <q>Figure 3.2.1</q>,
    as indicated in <xref ref="diagram-tactile-caption"/>.  This is
    meant to assist the person assembling the complete document.</p>

    <figure xml:id="diagram-tactile-caption">
      <caption>A tactile diagram with a caption added by
      <pretext/></caption>
      <image width="70%" source="images/de-system"/>
    </figure>

    <p>Since <pretext/> automatically adds the caption, you will most
    likely never need to worry about it.  However, should you want to
    add a caption manually, you can place a <tag>caption</tag> element
    as a child of the <tag>diagram</tag> as seen in <xref
    ref="listing-tactile-caption"/>. </p>

    <listing xml:id="listing-tactile-caption">
      <program line-numbers="no">
	<code><xi:include href="code/de-system.xml" parse="text"/></code>
      </program>
      <caption>The PreFigure source for <xref
      ref="diagram-tactile-caption"/>.</caption>
    </listing>

  <p>Captions are ignored except when generating a tactile version of
  the diagram.  If a diagram has a <tag>caption</tag> element, perhaps
  added by <pretext/>, its inclusion in a tactile version can be
  suppressed by including the <c>-s</c> flag in the build command:
  <cd>
    prefig build -f tactile -s foo.xml
  </cd>
  </p>
