  <title>Accessibility</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>PreFigure is designed to facilitate the creation of accessible
    mathematical diagrams.  In particular, diagrams can be annotated
    so that they may be effectively navigated with a screen reader,
    and tactile versions of diagrams may be created from the same
    PreFigure source.  This chapter will describe features of
    annotations and tactile diagrams in more detail.
    </p>

    <p>While these accessibility features are primarily intended to
    benefit low-vision and blind readers, attention to these features
    will help authors create better traditional diagrams for sighted
    readers.  Annotating a diagram requires an author to focus on the
    meaning of the diagram and how well the individual components
    contribute to clearly communicating that meaning.  Periodically
    building tactile versions of diagrams will illuminate ways in
    which authors might simplify the design of their diagrams so that
    their ideas are more clearly expressed.  It is often said that
    attention to accessibility issues improves the experience of
    everyone, and this is certainly true for the creation of
    mathematical diagrams.
