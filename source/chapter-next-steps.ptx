  <title>Next steps</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> PreFigure's basic graphical components, introduced in <xref
    ref="chap-graphical"/>, will suffice for many of your
    diagrams.  With those components as a foundation, this chapter
    will introduce some ways to improve your authoring experience.
    </p>

    <p>In particular, we will see how to make many copies of a
    component that differ only slightly using a <tag>repeat</tag>
    tag.  Stylistic choices, such as the color of a <tag>graph</tag>,
    can be applied to all diagrams in a project using a publication
    file.  Also, arrows have many uses in diagrams so we will see how
    to fine tune their appearance for different applications.
