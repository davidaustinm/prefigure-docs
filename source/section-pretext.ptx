  <title>Authoring diagrams within <pretext/></title>

  <p><pretext/> authors will notice that the design of <prefigure/>
  is very much inspired by <pretext/>.  In fact, it is possible to
  write <prefigure/> source directly inside a <pretext/> document.
  There are just a few things to be aware of.
  </p>
  
  <p>The diagram in <xref ref="diagram-pretext"/> was created inside
  a <pretext/> document, as we will explain.
  </p>
  
  <figure xml:id="diagram-pretext">
    <sidebyside width="60%">
      <image source="images/pretext-example"/>
    </sidebyside>
    <caption> A <prefigure/> diagram created inside a <pretext/>
    document as shown in <xref ref="listing-pretext"/>.
    </caption>
  </figure>
  
  <p><xref ref="listing-pretext"/> shows a portion of a <pretext/>
  document containing <prefigure/> source.  First, notice that
  we use a <pretext/> <tag>image</tag> element and place a
  <pretext/> <tag>prefigure</tag> element inside of it.  The
  <tag>prefigure</tag> element needs to have the attribute
  <attr>xmlns="https://prefigure.org"</attr>, which serves to
  effectively isolate any <prefigure/> source from the rest of the
  document, and a <attr>label</attr> giving the diagram a name.
  </p>
  
  <listing xml:id="listing-pretext">
    <program>
      <input><xi:include href="code/pretext-example.xml" parse="text"/>
      </input>
    </program>
    <caption> <prefigure/> source inside a <pretext/> document.
    </caption>
  </listing>
  
  <p>Rather than a publication file, as described in <xref
  ref="sec-publication"/>, default behaviors can be specified in the
  <pretext/> <tag>docinfo</tag> element as shown in <xref
  ref="listing-docinfo"/>.  Including this has the effect of applying
  the publication file given in <xref ref="listing-pub-file"/>.
  </p>

  <listing xml:id="listing-docinfo">
    <program>
      <input><xi:include href="code/pretext-docinfo.xml" parse="text"/>
      </input>
    </program>
    <caption> Within a <pretext/> document, <prefigure/> publication
    data is included inside <tag>docinfo</tag>.
    </caption>
  </listing>
  
  <p>Notice that the <latex/> macros defined inside
  <tag>docinfo/macros</tag>, which are available throughout the entire
  <pretext/> document, are also made available 
  for creating <prefigure/> labels.  In addition, you may
  add a <tag>prefigure-preamable</tag> element inside
  <tag>docinfo</tag> to change the default appearance of specified
  graphical components.  The <tag>prefigure-preamble</tag> element
  needs the same namespace attribute
  <attr>xmlns="https://prefigure.org"</attr> as the
  <tag>prefigure</tag> element.
  </p>
  
  <p>The <pretext/> document that created <xref
  ref="diagram-pretext"/> has a <tag>prefigure-preamble</tag> with a single
  <tag>rectangle</tag> element having attributes
  <attr>stroke="black"</attr> and <attr>fill="green"</attr>.  The
  <tag>macros</tag> includes the <latex/> macro to create the label
  <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
