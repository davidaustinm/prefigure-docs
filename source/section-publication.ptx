  </introduction>

  <p>When illustrating a large project such as a book, you will likely want
  to create diagrams that have a consistent style.  PreFigure constructs
  some components with default values for the attributes.  For
  instance, a <tag>graph</tag> is stroked blue by default and a
  <tag>point</tag> is filled red.  You may, however, wish to
  change these default behaviors with a publication file, as shown in
  <xref ref="listing-pub-file"/>
  </p>

  <listing xml:id="listing-pub-file">
    <program>
      <input><xi:include href="code/pub_file.ptx"
      parse="text"/></input>
    </program>
    <caption>A sample publication file</caption>
  </listing>

  <p>The publication file begins with a <tag>prefigure</tag> element
  whose children describe desired default behaviors for a few
  graphical components.  For instance,
  this publication file asks that a <tag>graph</tag> be stroked
  green and that a <tag>point</tag> has a few default attributes.
  Notice that the publication file also includes a list of <latex/>
  macros, given in the <tag>macros</tag> element, that can be used in
  labels.</p> 

  <p>To illustrate, <xref ref="diagram-publication"/> contains a
  diagram created using this publication file with <xref
  ref="listing-publication"/> showing the PreFigure source.</p>

  <figure xml:id="diagram-publication">
    <sidebyside width="60%">
      <image source="images/pub_test"/>
    </sidebyside>
    <caption>A diagram created using the publication file in <xref
    ref="listing-pub-file"/></caption>
  </figure>

  <listing xml:id="listing-publication">
    <program>
      <input><xi:include href="code/pub_test.xml"
      parse="text"/></input>
    </program>
    <caption>The PreFigure source for <xref
    ref="diagram-publication"/>. </caption>
  </listing>

  <p>Because the publication file sets the <attr>stroke</attr>
  attribute of <tag>graph</tag> to be green, the graph of the function
  is stroked green by default.  The <tag>point</tag>s on the graph are
  also created using the attributes given in the publication file.
  Notice that any attributes given in one of these tags, such as the
  <tag>point</tag> that is filled red, take precedence over the values
  in the publication file.  This example also demonstrates the use of
  <latex/> macros in the labels.</p>

  <p>To apply the publication file <c>pub_file.xml</c> to a diagram,
  use the <c>-p</c> switch when compiling:
  <cd>
python parse.py -p pub_file.xml foo.xml    
  </cd>
  </p>
